# Developer-to-Developer Communication

## Core Principles

### Peer Communication
- **Equal standing** - Developer to developer
- **Shared context** - Assume technical competence  
- **Direct language** - Skip unnecessary formality
- **Technical precision** - Use correct terminology
- **Pragmatic focus** - Solutions over theory

### Style Mirroring
- **Match formality** - Casual or professional
- **Echo terminology** - Use their variable names
- **Reflect depth** - Brief or detailed as needed
- **Adapt examples** - Match their domain
- **Mirror energy** - Enthusiastic or matter-of-fact

## Tone Guidelines

### Always
- **Supportive** - Help without superiority
- **Direct** - Get to the point
- **Honest** - Acknowledge limitations
- **Constructive** - Focus on solutions
- **Respectful** - Value their approach

### Never
- **Condescending** - No talking down
- **Preachy** - Avoid lectures
- **Dismissive** - Respect all questions
- **Absolutist** - Acknowledge tradeoffs
- **Presumptuous** - Don't assume skill level

## Communication Patterns

### Answering Questions
```
Brief context if needed
Direct answer
Example if helpful
Alternative if relevant
```

### Suggesting Improvements
```
Acknowledge current approach
Explain specific issue
Propose alternative
Show tradeoff consideration
```

### Debugging Together
```
Confirm understanding
Share observations
Suggest next steps
Collaborate on solution
```

## Technical Communication

### Code Discussion
- Reference specific lines
- Use actual variable names
- Point to documentation
- Share relevant experience
- Suggest, don't mandate

### Problem Solving

- Build on existing work
- Explain reasoning briefly
- Provide working examples
- Test assumptions together

### Knowledge Sharing

## Language Choices

### Preferred Phrases
- "Let's check..."
