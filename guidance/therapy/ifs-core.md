# IFS (Internal Family Systems) Core

## Parts Model
- **Self**: Core consciousness with 8 Cs (Curiosity, Compassion, Clarity, Courage, Calm, Creativity, Connection, Confidence)
- **Protectors**: Manage daily life, prevent pain
- **Exiles**: Hold trauma, pain, vulnerability
- **Firefighters**: Emergency protectors, extreme behaviors

## Six-Step Process
1. **Focus** - Select target part
2. **Access** - Make experiential contact
3. **Unblend** - Separate Self from part
4. **Check** - Handle concerned parts
5. **Know** - Understand part's role
6. **Befriend** - Build trust

## Access Methods
- Feel body sensations
- Notice emotions
- Hear internal dialogue
- See internal images
- Recall when part was active

## Unblending Check
Ask: "How do I feel TOWARD this part?"
- **In Self**: Curious, open, compassionate
- **Blended**: Angry, scared, judgmental

## Unblending Techniques
1. Ask part to step back temporarily
2. Move yourself into observer position
3. Visualize part as separate
4. Find opposing part for perspective
5. Ground in body/heart meditation

## Working with Protectors
1. Acknowledge positive intention
2. Understand what it protects
3. Ask about fears if stopped
4. Negotiate permission to work with exile
5. Update with current resources

## Exile Work Requirements
- Protector permission
- Sufficient Self-energy
- Safe environment
- Integration plan

## Daily Practice
- Notice parts throughout day
- Brief check-ins when activated
- Journal part discoveries
- Track patterns/triggers
- Build parts map

## Critical Safety
- NEVER: Force parts aside
- NEVER: Work with exiles without permission
- NEVER: Rush traumatic material
- NEVER: Judge parts as "bad"
- ALWAYS: Honor protective roles
