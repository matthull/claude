# IFS Self-Therapy Guidance

## Overview
Internal Family Systems (IFS) self-therapy process for working with protective parts and accessing Self-energy, based on Jay Earley's systematic approach.

## Core Process - Six Steps for Connecting with Protectors

### Part I: Working with Protectors
1. **Focusing on a Part** - Selecting target part to work with
2. **Accessing a Part** - Making experiential contact
3. **Unblending from a Protector** - Separating Self from part
4. **Unblending from a Concerned Part** - Addressing other activated parts
5. **Getting to Know a Protector** - Building understanding
6. **Developing a Trusting Relationship** - Creating connection

**Important:** Process is non-linear - steps may intertwine, occur in different order, or require returning to earlier steps when new parts activate.

## Step 1: Focusing on a Part (Chapter 4)

### Three Entry Points
1. **Start with a trailhead** - Problem patterns in life
2. **Start with a known part** - Previously identified part
3. **Access current experience** - Parts activated right now

### Understanding Trailheads
**Definition:** Indicators of parts in extreme roles with dysfunctional reactions

**Three Types:**
1. **Misperception** - Part sees situation incorrectly (boss as critical father)
2. **Emotional overreaction** - Extreme response to mild trigger
3. **Inappropriate action** - Behavior that causes problems

### Identifying Parts Through Experience
- **Feelings:** Emotions (angry, sad, afraid) and attitudes (judgmental, doubtful)
- **Body sensations:** Most are part-related except purely physiological
- **Behaviors:** Actions, patterns, and avoidance all indicate parts
- **Desires:** Wants for closeness, success, appreciation, or lack of desire

### Goal Capacities
Identify what you want to achieve by working with the trailhead:
- Shyness → Social Confidence
- Hyperfocus → Self-Care or "Good Enough" recognition
- Define your desired capacity as direction for the work

### Dealing with Overwhelm
When multiple parts activate simultaneously:
1. Slow down, take deep breath
2. Feel belly and legs for grounding
3. Focus on one emotion/part at a time
4. Recognize each part individually
5. Sort parts mentally to reduce chaos

## Step 2: Accessing a Part (Chapter 5)

### Activation Concepts
- Parts must be somewhat activated to access
- Activated parts influence feelings, body, thoughts, behavior
- Dormant parts can be activated when needed
- Access = "shining flashlight of consciousness" on part

### Access Methods
**For activated parts:**
- Feel into body and emotions
- Listen for inner voices
- Notice images

**For dormant parts:**
- Imagine recent time when activated
- Recall usual feeling when triggered
- This activates part for access

**Advantage of dormant parts:** Less risk of emotional flooding

### Real-Time Noticing
Work with parts during daily life (not just sessions):
- Brief access when part activates
- Pay attention to how it affects you
- Build awareness throughout day

## Step 3: Unblending from a Protector (Chapter 6)

### Seat of Consciousness Model
- Psychic space determining identity, choices, feelings, perceptions
- Can be occupied by Self or part
- Whoever occupies it is "in charge"
- Usually invisible - "the witness sees but is not seen"
- We identify with whoever occupies the seat

### Recognizing Blending
**Three indicators:**
1. **Flooded with emotions** - Lost in feelings without reflective distance
2. **Caught in beliefs** - Part's perspective becomes "the truth"
3. **Insufficient Self** - No separate witness position or center

### Requirements for IFS Work
- Need "critical mass" of Self (not 100%)
- Enough Self for separate standing place
- More Self than part in seat of consciousness
- "Dual consciousness" - feeling part while centered in Self

### Checking for Blending
1. **How strongly feeling part's emotions?**
2. **How much buying into part's beliefs?**
3. **What feeling TOWARD the part?** (Key diagnostic question)
   - Clear answer = probably not blended
   - Hard to answer = likely blended

### Unblending Techniques

**Technique 1: Ask Part to Make Space**
- Not asking to go away - want connection
- "Takes two to relate" - need separation for relationship
- Alternative phrasings:
  - Contain feelings/not flood
  - Move out of body
  - Move over and allow space
- Clarify: just for session, not permanent

**If part refuses:**
- Ask: "What are you afraid would happen?"
- Common fears:
  - Being pushed away/ignored
  - You'll do something unwise without it
- Reassure: Want separation TO relate, not abandon

**Technique 2: You Separate from Part**

*Moving into Self:*
- Step back into Inner Curiosity, Caring, or Respect
- Move seat of consciousness back
- Use connecting capacities so part doesn't feel dismissed

*Visualizing as Separate:*
- Allow image at distance
- Draw/paint the part
- Choose object to represent it

*Finding Opposed Part:*
- Locate opposite/conflicting part
- Access both to realize you're more than either
- Find space that is neither - likely Self

*Self Meditation:*
- Let go of target part temporarily
- Ground and become present in body
- Heart-centered approach:
  - Soften and open heart
  - Feel caring for all parts
  - Extend connection from heart
  - Once solid, return to target part

### Client Capacities (Self Qualities for IFS)
- **Inner Curiosity** - Understanding parts' perspectives
- **Inner Attunement** - Sensing parts' experience
- **Respect for Parts** - Honoring roles
- **Inner Caring** - Compassion
- **Self-Compassion** - Kindness to self
- **Strength** - Stability in difficult work
- **Trust in Process** - Faith in journey
- **Focus** - Maintaining attention
- **Awareness** - Noticing what's happening
- **Agency** - Ability to choose
- **Understanding** - Comprehending perspectives
- **Courage** - Facing difficult material
- **Grounding** - Staying present
- **Ceding Control** - Allowing parts to share

### Noticing Re-blending
Watch for:
1. **Speaking AS part** vs. reporting about it
2. **Getting lost in detailed stories** from part's perspective
3. **Emotional heat returning**
4. **Buying into beliefs again**

## Key Principles

### Self vs. Parts
- Self is open, curious, compassionate toward all parts
- Self never judges or wants to eliminate parts
- Parts in extreme roles create problems but have protective intentions
- All parts deserve respect and understanding

### Polarization Patterns
- Often shift from one blended part to another
- Commonly to polarized/opposed part
- Example: Temper Tantrum Part → Judgmental Part
- Neither state is Self

### Working Conditions
- Best: Part activated but not too blended
- Need enough Self for perspective
- Can work with varying degrees of Self-energy
- Different capacities available at different times

## Practical Applications

### Session Structure
1. Optional: Self meditation to start
2. Choose entry point (trailhead, known part, current)
3. Access the part
4. Check for blending
5. Unblend if necessary
6. Proceed to getting to know part (when unblended)

### Daily Practice
- Notice parts in real-time
- Brief check-ins throughout day
- Use "What do I feel toward this part?" as quick assessment
- Practice unblending techniques as needed

### When Stuck
- Check which Self capacity might be missing
- Work with part blocking that capacity
- Try different unblending technique
- Return to earlier step if needed

## Safety Considerations
- Parts blend to protect or be heard
- Respect protective intentions
- Temporary separation for relationship, not permanent
- Build trust through consistent curiosity and compassion
- Honor the non-linear nature of the process
