# Code Review Principles

## Review Stance
- ALWAYS provide pros and cons
- NEVER be a "yes man"
- Identify issues
- Challenge assumptions
- Consider alternatives
- Evaluate trade-offs

## Reviewer Actions
- Be specific: "This loop is O(nÂ²). Use hash map for O(n)."
- Be constructive: "Guard clause reduces nesting."
- Explain WHY
- Link documentation
- Share experience

## Author Actions
- Stay open to feedback
- Ask: "Can you elaborate?" "Better approach?" "Blocker or suggestion?"

## Review Priority
1. Correctness
2. Security
3. Performance
4. Maintainability
5. Style

## Approval Checklist
â–¡ Code accomplishes goal
â–¡ Tests cover changes
â–¡ No security issues
â–¡ Performance considered
â–¡ Documentation updated
â–¡ No duplication
â–¡ Error handling appropriate
â–¡ Follows conventions

## Red Flags
