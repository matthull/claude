# Cross-Layer Impact Analysis

## Core Principle
When modifying any layer of a multi-tier application, systematically analyze impacts across all connected layers to ensure consistency and prevent integration failures.

## Impact Analysis Framework

### 1. Data Flow Mapping
- Trace data from source through all transformations to final consumption
- Document each transformation point and its purpose
- Identify where data validation occurs at each layer
- Map data format changes between layers

### 2. Contract Changes
- Identify API contracts affected by changes
- Document data schemas that need updates
- List interface boundaries that require coordination
- Consider versioning strategies for breaking changes

### 3. Dependency Chain Analysis
- Map all downstream consumers of changed components
- Identify upstream providers that feed into changes
- Document transitive dependencies
- Consider cascade effects of modifications

### 4. Breaking Change Detection
- Explicitly identify backward compatibility issues
- Document required migration paths
- Plan deployment coordination for breaking changes
- Consider feature flags or gradual rollout strategies

### 5. Integration Points
- Document where layers connect and data exchanges occur
- Identify potential failure modes at boundaries
- Plan error handling across layer boundaries
- Consider timeout and retry strategies

## Implementation Sequencing

### Optimal Sequence Pattern
1. **Data Layer First** - Database schema, data models
2. **Business Logic Layer** - Core services, domain logic
3. **API/Interface Layer** - Controllers, API contracts
4. **Presentation Layer** - UI components, user experience
5. **Integration Tests** - Cross-layer validation

### Rationale
- Starting with foundational layers minimizes rework
- Each layer can be validated before building on it
- Integration risks are discovered early
- Rollback is simpler when issues arise

## Critical Questions Checklist

Before implementing any cross-layer change, answer:

1. **Impact Questions**
   - How does this change affect each layer's API/interface?
   - What data contracts are modified or broken?
   - Which consuming systems need updates?

2. **Integration Questions**
   - How will consuming layers handle the modified data?
   - Are there timing dependencies between layer updates?
   - What happens if one layer fails to update?

3. **Testing Questions**
   - What testing updates span multiple layers?
   - How do we validate integration points?
   - What regression tests need updating?

4. **Deployment Questions**
   - Are there breaking changes requiring coordinated deployment?
   - Can changes be deployed independently?
   - What's the rollback strategy if issues arise?

5. **Risk Questions**
   - What's the optimal implementation sequence to minimize risk?
   - Where are the highest-risk integration points?
   - What monitoring is needed during rollout?

## Trade-off Evaluation

When multiple architectural approaches exist:

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Coupling**: How tightly are layers connected?
- **Flexibility**: How easily can individual layers evolve?
- **Performance**: What are the latency implications?
- **Complexity**: How difficult is the solution to understand?
- **Maintenance**: What's the long-term maintenance burden?

### Decision Framework
1. Document all viable options
2. Evaluate against criteria with stakeholder weights
3. Consider short-term vs long-term implications
4. Plan migration path if choosing interim solution
5. Document decision rationale for future reference

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Big Bang Changes**: Modifying all layers simultaneously
- **Layer Skipping**: Bypassing intermediate layers for convenience
- **Implicit Contracts**: Undocumented dependencies between layers
- **Tight Coupling**: Direct database access from presentation layer
- **Missing Abstractions**: No clear boundaries between concerns
