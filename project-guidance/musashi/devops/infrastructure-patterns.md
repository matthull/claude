# Infrastructure and DevOps Patterns

## Infrastructure Assessment

### Current State Analysis
- Understand existing architecture before proposing changes
- Document current constraints and requirements
- Identify technical debt and pain points
- Map service dependencies and data flows
- Review monitoring and alerting coverage

### Root Cause Analysis
- Look beyond symptoms to underlying infrastructure issues
- Consider cascading effects across systems
- Review logs and metrics systematically
- Correlate events across multiple services
- Document findings and hypothesis

## Solution Design Principles

### Scalability Considerations
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- Consider both immediate fixes and long-term improvements
- Plan for traffic growth and usage patterns
- Balance performance, cost, and maintainability
- Build in capacity headroom

### Reliability Engineering
- Prioritize reliability over features
- Design for failure scenarios
- Implement graceful degradation
- Plan for disaster recovery
- Test failure modes regularly

## AWS Patterns

### Service Selection
- Choose managed services when appropriate
- Understand service limits and quotas
- Consider regional availability
- Plan for service dependencies
- Document service configurations

### Security Best Practices
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Use IAM roles over access keys
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Implement network segmentation
- Regular security audits

### Cost Optimization
- Right-size instances based on metrics
- Use reserved instances for baseline load
- Implement auto-scaling for variable load
- Clean up unused resources
- Monitor and alert on cost anomalies

## Heroku Patterns

### Dyno Management
- Understand dyno types and sizing
- Configure dyno scaling appropriately
- Monitor memory usage and swapping
- Plan for dyno cycling
- Use worker dynos for background jobs

### Add-on Selection
- Evaluate add-on capabilities and limits
- Consider data residency requirements
- Plan for add-on scaling
- Monitor add-on performance
- Have backup plans for add-on failures

### Deployment Strategies
- Use review apps for testing
- Implement staging environments
- Plan zero-downtime deployments
- Use release phase for migrations
- Monitor deployment health

## Database Administration

### PostgreSQL Optimization
- Monitor query performance regularly
- Identify and resolve slow queries
- Plan index strategy carefully
- Configure connection pooling
- Regular vacuum and analyze

### Elasticsearch Management
- Design index strategy for performance
- Monitor cluster health and storage
- Plan for shard distribution
- Implement snapshot policies
- Configure appropriate heap sizes

### Redis Operations
- Choose appropriate persistence strategy
- Monitor memory usage and eviction
- Design key expiration policies
- Plan for cache warming
- Implement connection pooling

### Backup and Recovery
- Implement automated backup schedules
- Test restore procedures regularly
- Document recovery time objectives
- Store backups in multiple locations
- Monitor backup success/failure

## Containerization

### Docker Best Practices
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Pin base image versions
- Minimize layers and image size
- Implement proper health checks
- Use specific tags, not latest

### Container Security
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Run containers as non-root
- Use read-only filesystems where possible
- Limit container capabilities
- Keep base images updated

### Orchestration Patterns
- Design for container ephemerality
- Implement proper service discovery
- Use declarative configuration
- Plan for rolling updates
- Monitor container resources

## CI/CD Pipeline Design

### GitHub Actions Patterns
- Use matrix builds for multiple versions
- Cache dependencies appropriately
- Parallelize test execution
- Implement proper secret management
- Monitor workflow execution time

### Deployment Automation
- Implement infrastructure as code
- Use blue-green or canary deployments
- Automate rollback procedures
- Gate deployments with tests
- Monitor deployment metrics

### Testing Integration
- Run tests in parallel when possible
- Fail fast on critical issues
- Implement smoke tests for deployments
- Use test result reporting
- Monitor test flakiness

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Strategy
- Define key performance indicators
- Implement custom metrics for business logic
- Use appropriate metric types
- Set up dashboards for different audiences
- Regular metric review and cleanup

### Logging Architecture
- Centralize log aggregation
- Implement structured logging
- Define log retention policies
- Use appropriate log levels
- Correlate logs across services

### Alerting Philosophy
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Avoid alert fatigue
- Define clear escalation paths
- Document alert runbooks
- Regular alert review and tuning

## Local Development Environment

### Docker Compose Patterns
- Mirror production architecture locally
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement data seeding strategies
- Optimize for developer productivity
- Document setup procedures

### Development Tool Selection
- Choose tools that match production
- Implement hot reloading where possible
- Use consistent versions across team
- Automate environment setup
- Regular toolchain updates

## Troubleshooting Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. Start with logs and metrics to understand scope
2. Identify what changed recently
3. Check for cascading failures
4. Isolate problem to specific component
5. Test hypothesis before implementing fix

### Incident Response
- Provide immediate mitigation first
- Document actions taken
- Communicate status regularly
- Plan permanent resolution
- Conduct post-mortems

### Performance Debugging
- Profile before optimizing
- Identify bottlenecks systematically
- Test improvements in isolation
- Monitor impact of changes
- Document performance baselines

## Security Practices

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular security updates and patches
- Network segmentation and firewalls
- Secrets management solutions
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Regular security assessments

### Compliance Considerations
- Understand compliance requirements
- Implement necessary controls
- Document security procedures
- Regular compliance audits
- Incident response planning

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Manual server configuration
- Hardcoded secrets in code
- Missing monitoring or alerting
- No backup strategy
