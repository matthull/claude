# Auto-Guidance Skill Configuration

# Master switch - set to false to disable auto-guidance entirely
enabled: true

# Maximum number of guidance files to load per trigger event
# Prevents context window overload when multiple patterns match
max_per_trigger: 2

# Notification style when guidance is loaded
# Options: "brief", "detailed", "silent"
#   brief: "📚 Loaded testing guidance (test-driven-development.md)"
#   detailed: "📚 Loaded testing guidance from ~/.claude/guidance/testing/test-driven-development.md (matched: *_spec.rb)"
#   silent: No notifications (guidance still loads)
notification: "brief"

# Performance tracking - logs timing data for analysis
# When enabled, tracks pattern matching and guidance loading times
performance_tracking: false

# Where to write performance logs (only if performance_tracking: true)
# Logs include: timestamp, operation, file_path, duration_ms, matched, loaded
performance_log: "/tmp/claude-auto-guidance-perf.log"

# Report performance summary every N file operations
# Set to 0 to disable periodic reporting
report_interval: 20

# Warn if pattern matching exceeds this threshold (milliseconds)
# Helps identify performance issues early
max_pattern_time_ms: 50

# Prioritization when multiple guidance files match
# Options: "project_first", "global_first", "alphabetical"
#   project_first: Load project-specific guidance before global
#   global_first: Load global guidance before project-specific
#   alphabetical: Load in alphabetical order
priority: "project_first"

# Skip auto-guidance for these file patterns
# Useful for excluding generated files, assets, etc.

  - "*.log"
  - "*.tmp"
