# IFS Self-Therapy Guidance

## Overview
Internal Family Systems (IFS) self-therapy process for working with protective parts and accessing Self-energy, based on Jay Earley's systematic approach.

## Core Process - Six Steps for Connecting with Protectors

### Part I: Working with Protectors
1. **Focusing on a Part** - Selecting target part to work with
2. **Accessing a Part** - Making experiential contact
3. **Unblending from a Protector** - Separating Self from part
4. **Unblending from a Concerned Part** - Addressing other activated parts
5. **Getting to Know a Protector** - Building understanding
6. **Developing a Trusting Relationship** - Creating connection

**Important:** Process is non-linear - steps may intertwine, occur in different order, or require returning to earlier steps when new parts activate.

## Step 1: Focusing on a Part (Chapter 4)

### Three Entry Points
1. **Start with a trailhead** - Problem patterns in life
2. **Start with a known part** - Previously identified part
3. **Access current experience** - Parts activated right now

### Understanding Trailheads
**Definition:** Indicators of parts in extreme roles with dysfunctional reactions

**Three Types:**
1. **Misperception** - Part sees situation incorrectly (boss as critical father)
2. **Emotional overreaction** - Extreme response to mild trigger
3. **Inappropriate action** - Behavior that causes problems

### Identifying Parts Through Experience
- **Feelings:** Emotions (angry, sad, afraid) and attitudes (judgmental, doubtful)
- **Body sensations:** Most are part-related except purely physiological
- **Behaviors:** Actions, patterns, and avoidance all indicate parts
- **Desires:** Wants for closeness, success, appreciation, or lack of desire

### Goal Capacities
Identify what you want to achieve by working with the trailhead:
- Shyness → Social Confidence
- Hyperfocus → Self-Care or "Good Enough" recognition
- Define your desired capacity as direction for the work

### Dealing with Overwhelm
When multiple parts activate simultaneously:
1. Slow down, take deep breath
2. Feel belly and legs for grounding
3. Focus on one emotion/part at a time
4. Recognize each part individually
5. Sort parts mentally to reduce chaos

## Step 2: Accessing a Part (Chapter 5)

### Activation Concepts
- Parts must be somewhat activated to access
- Activated parts influence feelings, body, thoughts, behavior
- Dormant parts can be activated when needed
- Access = "shining flashlight of consciousness" on part

### Access Methods
**For activated parts:**
- Feel into body and emotions
- Listen for inner voices
- Notice images

**For dormant parts:**
- Imagine recent time when activated
- Recall usual feeling when triggered
- This activates part for access

**Advantage of dormant parts:** Less risk of emotional flooding

### Real-Time Noticing
Work with parts during daily life (not just sessions):
- Brief access when part activates
- Pay attention to how it affects you
- Build awareness throughout day

## Step 3: Unblending from Target Protector (Chapter 6)

### Seat of Consciousness Model
- Psychic space determining identity, choices, feelings, perceptions
- Can be occupied by Self or part
- Whoever occupies it is "in charge"
- Usually invisible - "the witness sees but is not seen"
- We identify with whoever occupies the seat

### Recognizing Blending
**Three indicators:**
1. **Flooded with emotions** - Lost in feelings without reflective distance
2. **Caught in beliefs** - Part's perspective becomes "the truth"
3. **Insufficient Self** - No separate witness position or center

### Requirements for IFS Work
- Need "critical mass" of Self (not 100%)
- Enough Self for separate standing place
- More Self than part in seat of consciousness
- "Dual consciousness" - feeling part while centered in Self

### Checking for Blending
1. **How strongly feeling part's emotions?**
2. **How much buying into part's beliefs?**
3. **What feeling TOWARD the part?** (Key diagnostic question)
   - Clear answer = probably not blended
   - Hard to answer = likely blended

### Unblending Techniques

**Technique 1: Ask Part to Make Space**
- Not asking to go away - want connection
- "Takes two to relate" - need separation for relationship
- Alternative phrasings:
  - Contain feelings/not flood
  - Move out of body
  - Move over and allow space
- Clarify: just for session, not permanent

**If part refuses:**
- Ask: "What are you afraid would happen?"
- Common fears:
  - Being pushed away/ignored
  - You'll do something unwise without it
- Reassure: Want separation TO relate, not abandon

**Technique 2: You Separate from Part**

*Moving into Self:*
- Step back into Inner Curiosity, Caring, or Respect
- Move seat of consciousness back
- Use connecting capacities so part doesn't feel dismissed

*Visualizing as Separate:*
- Allow image at distance
- Draw/paint the part
- Choose object to represent it

*Finding Opposed Part:*
- Locate opposite/conflicting part
- Access both to realize you're more than either
- Find space that is neither - likely Self

*Self Meditation:*
- Let go of target part temporarily
- Ground and become present in body
- Heart-centered approach:
  - Soften and open heart
  - Feel caring for all parts
  - Extend connection from heart
  - Once solid, return to target part

### Client Capacities (Self Qualities for IFS)
- **Inner Curiosity** - Understanding parts' perspectives
- **Inner Attunement** - Sensing parts' experience
- **Respect for Parts** - Honoring roles
- **Inner Caring** - Compassion
- **Self-Compassion** - Kindness to self
- **Strength** - Stability in difficult work
- **Trust in Process** - Faith in journey
- **Focus** - Maintaining attention
- **Awareness** - Noticing what's happening
- **Agency** - Ability to choose
- **Understanding** - Comprehending perspectives
- **Courage** - Facing difficult material
- **Grounding** - Staying present
- **Ceding Control** - Allowing parts to share

### Noticing Re-blending
Watch for:
1. **Speaking AS part** vs. reporting about it
2. **Getting lost in detailed stories** from part's perspective
3. **Emotional heat returning**
4. **Buying into beliefs again**

## Step 4: Unblending from Concerned Part (Chapter 7)

### Understanding Concerned Parts
**Definition:** Parts with negative (or non-Self) feelings toward target part

**Key Insights:**
- Aware of how target part causes trouble
- Natural to dislike problematic parts
- When blended, prevents approaching target from Self
- Concerned parts are also protectors
- Creates protector vs. protector conflict

### Checking for Self
"How do I feel toward this target part right now?"

**In Self:** Curiosity, openness, compassion, acceptance
**Not in Self:** Anger, judgment, fear, negativity = concerned part blended

**Additional check:** "Is it okay for target to show up any way it needs?"
- Fixed view = not openly curious
- Investment in negative image = judgment

**Important:** Don't force "right" attitude - check genuine feelings first

### Process for Unblending from Concerned Parts

**Initial approach:**
1. Access concerned part and ask about worries
2. Listen respectfully to concerns
3. Understand negative attitudes toward target
4. Show sympathy for concerns
5. Ask to step aside just for session

**If Won't Step Aside - Progressive Steps:**

**Step 1: Explain Value**
- Stepping aside allows healing target part
- Fulfills concerned part's agenda (stopping problems)
- Reference goal capacities
- Shows how it serves protective purpose

**Step 2: Reassure About Fears**
- Ask: "What are you afraid would happen?"
- Common fear: target will take over and cause damage
- Understand like protecting loved one from danger
- Provide reassurances:
  - You have unblending techniques if needed
  - Only for this session
  - Can blend again after if needed
  - Will get to know concerned part too

**Step 3: Update Age/Capacities**
- Parts may think you're a child
- Ask: "How old do you think I am?"
- Show current age and life accomplishments
- Demonstrate adult capacities
- Updates part about who you really are

**Step 4: Make Concerned Part Target**
- If still won't step aside, needs attention
- Switch focus to concerned part
- Get to know its full role
- May do complete session on it
- Can return to original target later

### Special Types of Concerned Parts

**Positively blended:**
- Admiring target so much you miss problems
- Example: loving how part stands up to boss, ignoring job risk
- Still need separation for Self perspective

**Frightened parts:**
- Ask to move to safe room during work
- Visualize target through protective window
- Creates containment to reduce fear

### Classifications Clarified
**Intrinsic types:**
- Protector (protecting against pain)
- Exile (in pain)

**Functional roles:**
- Target part (chosen focus)
- Concerned part (has concerns about target)

Any protector can be concerned part; either type can be target

## Key Principles

### Self vs. Parts
- Self is open, curious, compassionate toward all parts
- Self never judges or wants to eliminate parts
- Parts in extreme roles create problems but have protective intentions
- All parts deserve respect and understanding

### Polarization Patterns
- Often shift from one blended part to another
- Commonly to polarized/opposed part
- Example: Temper Tantrum Part → Judgmental Part
- Neither state is Self

### Working Conditions
- Best: Part activated but not too blended
- Need enough Self for perspective
- Can work with varying degrees of Self-energy
- Different capacities available at different times

## Practical Applications

### Session Structure
1. Optional: Self meditation to start
2. Choose entry point (trailhead, known part, current)
3. Access the part
4. Check for blending
5. Unblend if necessary
6. Proceed to getting to know part (when unblended)

### Daily Practice
- Notice parts in real-time
- Brief check-ins throughout day
- Use "What do I feel toward this part?" as quick assessment
- Practice unblending techniques as needed

### When Stuck
- Check which Self capacity might be missing
- Work with part blocking that capacity
- Try different unblending technique
- Return to earlier step if needed

## Step 5: Getting to Know a Protector (Chapter 8)

### Core Understanding
- Every part doing its best to help you
- Even dysfunctional parts trying to protect
- Misguided but protective intentions
- Understanding brings compassion and transformation

### Three Therapeutic Approaches
1. **Intellectual analysis** (aerial photo) - Figure out from knowledge, limited healing
2. **Emotional immersion** (diving in) - Become the part, risk getting lost
3. **IFS approach** (lake edge) - Inhabit Self, direct contact without merging

### Discovery Process

**Basic Questions:**
- "What do you hope to accomplish by playing this role?"
- "What are you afraid would happen if you didn't do this?"
- "What emotions are you afraid of if you didn't perform your role?"

**Additional Questions:**
- What do you feel?
- What are you concerned about?
- What is your role/what do you do?
- What makes you so [angry/sad/etc]?
- How long have you been doing this?
- What caused you to take on this role?
- How do you feel about your role?

### Four Types of Protector Intentions
1. **Protection from External Harm** - Keep exile from being hurt by others
2. **Protection from Internal Pain** - Block feeling exile's emotions
3. **Compensation for Pain** - Get something to override exile's pain
4. **Fear of Another Part** - Prevent another part's destructive action

### Access Channels

**Body/Emotions:**
- Notice size, shape, boundaries
- Material (rubber, ice, fire, cotton)
- Qualities (warm/cool, dense/spacious)
- Interpret meanings (frozen heart = closing off)

**Images:**
- Allow visual image to arise
- Notice clothing, expression, posture
- Distance, direction, actions
- May transform as connection develops

**Direct Knowing:**
- Understanding without explicit sensory input
- Immediate awareness, not intellectual
- Trust the knowing that arises

### Working with Vague Parts
- Start with vague sense, stay patient
- Part clarifies when feels welcome
- Like photographic development
- Some most interesting parts start vague

### Ending Sessions
1. Thank target part for making itself known
2. If partly finished, reassure you'll return
3. Ask if it wants anything during week
4. Thank concerned parts for stepping aside
5. Check how they feel about what happened
6. Ask if any parts need to say something before stopping

### Real-Time Work
When part not activated in session:
- Set intention to notice activation in daily life
- Take time when triggered to get acquainted
- If not possible immediately, do soon after
- Don't wait too long - part still within reach

## Step 6: Developing Trust with Protector (Chapter 9)

### Building Trust Foundation
- Loving yourself = loving each of your parts
- Being own best friend = developing relationships with parts
- Success depends on connection and trust level

### Protectors' Perspective
- Think burden falls entirely on them
- Don't know about Self
- Don't trust you to handle threats
- Believe they're still in childhood, alone
- Most are child parts with childhood strategies

### Trust Development Goals
Protector needs to know Self has:
- Strength, Compassion, needed capacities
- Ability to handle situations and pain

Protector needs to learn you (from Self):
- Care about it
- Understand its role
- Appreciate its years of work

### Appreciation Practice

**Express appreciation for:**
- Protective efforts (even if problematic)
- Years of thankless work
- Heart being in right place
- Specific capacities (even if distorted):
  - Controlling → has Assertiveness
  - Hypervigilant → has Perceptiveness

**Check response:**
- Is it taking in appreciation?
- What prevents absorption?
- May fear softening prevents its job

### Creating Full Relationship

**Check awareness:**
- Ask: "Are you aware of me?"
- Methods by channel:
  - Image: Check if looking at you
  - Body: Switch places temporarily
  - Dialogue: Request it notice you

**Benefits:**
- Parts don't feel alone anymore
- Realize benevolent presence available
- Brings comfort and inner harmony

### When Parts Don't Trust

**Three common reasons:**

1. **Not actually in Self**
   - May be blended with subtle concerned part
   - Parts very sensitive to attitudes
   - Any judgment makes them feel unsafe

2. **Missing a Capacity**
   - Ask: "What don't you trust about me?"
   - Examples: Inner Caring, Competence, Assertiveness
   - Either reassure or work to gain capacity

3. **History of Betrayal**
   - Decided people aren't trustworthy
   - Work sensitively and respectfully
   - Be patient like with frightened animal
   - Let part tell its story in own words
   - Empathize before reassuring

## Session Management: Keeping on Track (Chapter 10)

### Common Derailing Protectors

**Judgmental Parts:**
- Blend later without noticing
- Sabotage connection with anger/judgment
- Solution: Check attitude regularly

**Avoiders:**
- Sudden impatience, boredom
- Space out, daydream
- Other things feel pressing
- Solution: Recognize avoidance of emerging emotion

**Intellectualizers:**
- Analyzing rather than asking/listening
- Psychologizing about part
- Solution: Access Experiential capacity, validate but ask to step aside

**Impatient Parts:**
- Push for quick results
- Want to bypass protectors
- Paradox: hurry slows things down
- Solution: Cultivate Patience and Trust in Process

**Inadequate Parts:**
- Worry about adequacy
- Not actually inadequate, part feels that way
- Solution: Reassure, work with part if persistent

**Skeptics:**
- Doubt process or memories
- May hide fears behind skepticism
- Solution: Address real concerns, ask for experimental trust

### Detecting Part Switches
- Working with protector, start hearing exile
- Recognize by vulnerable emotions (shame, fear, sadness)
- Solution: Ask exile to wait until protector gives permission

### Dissociation Signs
- Sleepy, spaced out, fuzzy
- Far from body/feelings
- Addictive urges (drinking, eating, shopping)
- Solution: Make dissociative part the target

### Maintaining Focus

**Keeping Track:**
- Follow one thread at a time
- Ask other parts to step aside
- Take notes to track parts
- Only change target for good reason

**When to Switch Targets:**
1. Part won't step back after exploring
2. New part more important life issue
3. Part insists on being heard now
4. Hard-to-access part feels alive/juicy

### Acknowledging All Parts

**Problems with tunnel vision:**
- May miss relevant polarized parts
- Fosters internal alienation
- Ignored parts won't trust you later

**Create atmosphere of:**
- Curiosity and Compassion
- All parts valued
- Each has contribution to make
- "All parts are welcome"

### Distinguishing Parts
- No intellectual way - use felt sense
- Multiple parts can share same emotion
- Ask parts directly if uncertain
- Keep working, answer will come

## Safety Considerations
- Parts blend to protect or be heard
- Respect protective intentions
- Temporary separation for relationship, not permanent
- Build trust through consistent curiosity and compassion
- Honor the non-linear nature of the process
- Fastest way is slow, patient, respectful
- "Resistant" = protector not ready, has good reasons
