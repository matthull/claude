# Verbose Original Files Archive

This directory contains the original verbose versions of guidance files before they were rewritten to comply with ultra-concise enforcement rules.

## Why Archive?
- Preserve detailed reference material
- Historical context if needed
- Source material for future refinements
- Not loaded by @-references (out of active guidance)

## Archived Files
- `ifs-self-therapy.md` (546 lines) → Rewritten as `therapy/ifs-core.md` (66 lines)
- `ifs-protector-work.md` (229 lines) → Merged into `therapy/ifs-techniques.md` (85 lines)

## Note
These files are intentionally verbose and DO NOT follow the guidance library's conciseness rules. They are kept for reference only and should not be used as active guidance.
